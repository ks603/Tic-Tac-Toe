## Description

This is the first project at General Assembly. For the first project i will be making Tic Tac Toe.,
There will be multiple options allows such as user sign up, sign in, and sign out. There will also,
be options such as to change your password and see how many games you played. The user will have,
access tot their account by signing up with their email address. Two players will be able to play,
from the same console.

I also will add messages throughout the game to let you know if your executed action was successfull,
or not. This will help make the playing process as smooth as possible. I hope to some style also so,
that it is as enjoyable version of Tic Tac Toe as possible.


### User Stories

- As a user I want to sign in and sign up successfully
- As a user I want to sign out and change password.
- As a user I want to play with a friend.
- As a user I want to be able to start a new game.
- As a user I want to see how many games have played.
- As a user I want to see who if any won the game.

### Technologies Used

- jQuery
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript

### Future

- In the future I would like to be able to play across different consoles. I would like to,
  make it so you can play from seperate computers. Making it a true multiplayer experience.
- Would like to upgrade some of the styles and make the sign in and sign up page a lot better,
  looking from a style perspective.
